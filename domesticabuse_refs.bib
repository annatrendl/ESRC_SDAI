abstract = {Suppose you are a physician with a patient whose complaint could arise from multiple diseases. To attain a specific diagnosis, you might ask yourself a series of yes/no questions depending on observed features describing the patient, such as clinical test results and reported symptoms. As some questions rule out certain diagnoses early on, each answer determines which question you ask next. With about a dozen features and extensive medical knowledge, you could create a simple flow chart to connect and order these questions. If you had observations of thousands of features instead, you would probably want to automate. Machine learning methods can learn which questions to ask about these features to classify the entity they describe. Even when we lack prior knowledge, a classifier can tell us which features are most important and how they relate to, or interact with, each other. Identifying interactions with large numbers of features poses a special challenge. In PNAS, Basu et al. (1) address this problem with a new classifier based on the widely used random forest technique. The new method, an iterative random forest algorithm (iRF), increases the robustness of random forest classifiers and provides a valuable new way to identify important feature interactions. Random forests came into the spotlight in 2001 after their description by Breiman (2). He was largely influenced by previous work, especially the similar “randomized trees” method of Amit and Geman (3), as well as Ho's “random decision forests” (4). Random forests have since proven useful in many fields due to their high predictive accuracy (5, 6). In biology and medicine, random forests have successfully tackled a range of problems, including predicting drug response in cancer cell lines (7), identifying DNA-binding proteins (8), and localizing cancer to particular tissues from a liquid biopsy (9). Random forests have also {\ldots} [↵][1]1To whom correspondence should be addressed. Email: michael.hoffman{\{}at{\}}utoronto.ca. [1]: {\#}xref-corresp-1-1},

abstract = {Objectives. We examined the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and its association with social deprivation in England. Methods. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate IPV correlates among 21 226 men and women aged 16 to 59 years in the 2008 nationally representative cross-sectional British Crime Survey. Results. Lifetime IPV was reported by 23.8{\%} of women and 11.5{\%} of men. Physical IPV was reported by 16.8{\%} and 7.0{\%}, respectively; emotional-only IPV was reported by 5.8{\%} and 4.2{\%}, respectively. After adjustment for demographic confounders, lifetime physical IPV experienced by women was associated with social housing tenure (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 2.0, 2.7), low household income (OR = 2.2; 95{\%} CI = 1.8, 2.7), poor educational attainment (OR = 1.2; 95{\%} CI = 1.0, 1.5), low social class (OR = 1.5; 95{\%} CI = 0.3, 1.7), and living in a multiply deprived area (OR = 1.4; 95{\%} CI = 1.1, 1.7). Physical IPV experienced by men and emotional IPV experienced by either gender were generally not associated with deprivation factors. Conclusions. Physical and emotional IPV are very common among adults in England. Emotional IPV prevention policies may be appropriate across the social spectrum; those for physical IPV should be particularly accessible to disadvantaged women.},

abstract = {Children's experiences and voices are underrepresented in academic literature and professional practice around domestic violence and abuse. The project “Understanding Agency and Resistance Strategies” (UNARS) addresses this absence, through direct engagement with children. We present an analysis from interviews with 21 children in the United Kingdom (12 girls and 9 boys, aged 8-18 years), about their experiences of domestic violence and abuse, and their responses to this violence. These interviews were analyzed using interpretive interactionism. Three themes from this analysis are presented: (a) “Children's experiences of abusive control,” which explores children's awareness of controlling behavior by the adult perpetrator, their experience of that control, and its impact on them; (b) “Constraint,” which explores how children experience the constraint associated with coercive control in situations of domestic violence; and (c) “Children as agents,” which explores children's strategies for managing control...},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) are associated with increased risk of mental illness, but we know little about the mental health of female DVA survivors seeking support from domestic violence services. OBJECTIVE Our goal was to characterise the demography and mental health of women who access specialist DVA services in the United Kingdom and to investigate associations between severity of abuse and measures of mental health and health state utility, accounting for important confounders and moderators. DESIGN Baseline data on 260 women enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a psychological intervention for DVA survivors were analysed. We report the prevalence of and associations between mental health status and severity of abuse at the time of recruitment. We used logistic and normal regression models for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. The following mental health measures were used: Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment, and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale to measure posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Composite Abuse Scale (CAS) measured abuse. RESULTS Exposure to DVA was high, with a mean CAS score of 56 (SD 34). The mean CORE-OM score was 18 (SD 8) with 76{\%} above the clinical threshold (95{\%} confidence interval: 70-81{\%}). Depression and anxiety levels were high, with means close to clinical thresholds, and more than three-quarters of respondents recorded PTSD scores above the clinical threshold. Symptoms of mental illness increased stepwise with increasing severity of DVA. CONCLUSIONS Women DVA survivors who seek support from DVA services have recently experienced high levels of abuse, depression, anxiety, and especially PTSD. Clinicians need to be aware that patients presenting with mental health conditions or symptoms of depression or anxiety may be experiencing or have experienced DVA. The high psychological morbidity in this population means that trauma-informed psychological support is needed for survivors who seek support from DVA services.},
