# The behavioural economics of domestic abuse

## Unique and new big-data perspective

We bring a data science approach to the study of domestic abuse data. We use data from West Midlands Police (serving X.X million people), Lloyds Banking Group (the UK's largest retail bank with 22 million customers), and the Crime survey for England and Wales. Our approach is new and ambitious, yet eminently feasible as we already hold the necessary data. We have support from Deputy Chief constable Louisa Rolfe at West Midlands Police, who is also the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for domestic abuse. Named postdoc Trendl works as a postdoc here at Warwick and is also an employee of Lloyds Banking Group in their behavioural and data science team. We have director level support from Lloyds Banking Group for the project. Applying data at this scale to the study of domestic abuse has never been done before. 

No one else has or is currently proposing to take a data science view of domestic abuse across multiple, diverse datasets. Other work focusses on a qualitative approach of case studies and interviews. Quantitative work in the area (such as that by Sylvia Walby which was raised by reviewers) has only incorporated a single data source (such as the CSEW, or data from a police force), and does not incorporate external data which can provide additional data on potential causes and environmental risk factors. We will be the first to demonstrate how mass administrative data can be combined from multiple sources and used to address domestic abuse. We have a track record in using such data for social science (see

Muggleton, Parpart, Newall, Leake, Gathergood, Stewart "Gambling-related harm in mass transaction data" Under review at _Nature_.) For example, in the paper on gambling we use Lloyds Banking Group transaction data from millions of invidiuals to demonstrate that gambling is associated with increased financial distress, reduced lifestyle and health outcomes, higher rates of future unemployment and disability, and higher mortality rates. This view is unique and the first ever to demonstrate such associations---again complementing the traditional qualitative case-study and small survey based approach. I THINK THE GAMBLING EXAMPLE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE WILL DELIVER FOR DOMESTIC ABUSE.)

Our approach contrasts with the qualitative approach using case studies and interviews. Our findings will complement this qualitative literature. It is from this qualitative background that the reviewers appear to have come---no reviewer had expertise in data science or econometrics. Their criticism is focussed on us as new researchers in their domain and on the feasibility of the work. We mitigate the former risk by working with an advisory board and including coauthors from a domestic abuse background. We mitigate the latter risk by already holding or having access to all of the data needed for the project, with necessary data sharing and other legal agreements signed and in place. 

## There are factual errors in the reviews:



## There are also unreasonable suggestions:

1. Having Lloyds Banking Group as a partner in the research is a huge asset. Lloyds are the largest retail bank with 22 million customers. It is unnecessary to have data from a second retail bank and would be logistically impossible for any researchers. By using weighted sampling of the 22 million, we can construct any representative sample and still achieve a sample size far in excess of any ever used to study domestic abuse.

2. We are aware of the issues when using police data. We are extremely familiar with the West Midlands Police data, and have worked with WMP on projects in stop and search, domestic abuse, risk assessment in custody, and alcohol and police resources. We are mitigating the issues with police data by working with bank data and with CSEW data. 

3. It is not possible to provide a complete review of the literature in a six page proposal. Not is it reasonable to cite studies that are not directly relevant. We are fully aware of the studies XXXXX and the ESRC funded proposal XXXXX. The latter focusses upon testing the existing DASH framework, and recent outputs have shown that it has little to no explanatory power for identifying at-risk individuals. Hence our proposed research to build upon this by identifying reliable indicative patterns in a data science approach.

4. We already have access to all relevant data. Concerns raised are not relevant. We hold the police data and CSEW data here on servers at Warwick. Postdoc Trendl is already working with Lloyds data, being employed by Lloyds Banking Group as well as Warwick. Approvals and data sharing agreements are already signed. We stated this in the proposal.

5. As the application of multiple, very large datasets to research in domestic abuse is novel, there is no one with the required skills in econometrics and data science who also has a substantial track record in domestic abuse research to conduct this research. Requiring such a background would make it impossible to complete the research, because no such individuals exist. We have acknowledged this from the start, hence our working closely with domestic abuse leads in the police, and why we propose including an advisory panel. 

We adopt the following adjustments in response to the reviewers:

We take the semantic point about describing children who witness male to female intimate partner violence as victims of domestic abuse, noting that the act of witnessing such events is what makes them victims. The user reviewer has made clear their views of the language used to describe such circumstances. The reviewer is clearly reluctant for this component of the research to be completed. We believe this arises from a difference of perspectives: we aim to identify the risk factors for later criminal behaviour, not out of a desire to stereotype or assign blame, but to better identify vulnerable individuals. It is an empirical question, whether such individuals are more likely to commit crime later. If they are, we have a societal responsibility to offer support to help them avoid this, not to simply blame. 

The reviewer is also reluctant about the investigation of certain socio-economic factors such as the effect of benefit payment systems, expressing concern about potential working class stereotypes. Their assertion is absolutely correct that domestic abuse exists in all sections of society. However, prior research shows a significant role of financial poverty, with the CSEW showing domestic abuse rates 3.5 times higher in very low income homes compared to middle and high income.

We will establish an advisory board for the project, comprising a senior police officer from West Midlands Police, a senior member of the WMP Police and Crime Commissioner's Office, an academic with experience in domestic abuse, Prof Vanessa Munro, a lawyer based here at Warwick with extensive experience of domestic abuse, and a member of the charity sector (NAME CHARITY) and a survivor of domestic abuse (NOMINATED BY THE CHARITY).

We are familiar with the Walby papers on the cost of domestic abuse. We agree they are important seminal works. Our proposal builds upon their results from qualitative works and analysis of the CSEW, by integrating far more data, from more sources, and using more advanced data analytic techniques.

%We have studied the currently funded ESRC project INSERT PROJECT NAME AND PI. Our proposal is quite different and compliments this work without duplication.
