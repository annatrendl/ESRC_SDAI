# Objectives

List the main objectives of the proposed research [up to 4000 chars]


1) To conduct the first large-scale, quantitative exploration of the individual- and neighbourhood-level risk factors of domestic abuse victimisation. Rigorous validation of insights from existing, mostly quantitative investigations using an UK-wide dataset, providing a deeper understanding of the environments perpetuating domestic abuse. While we will only use UK data, these findings will likely to be relevant for resarchers outside the UK. 

2) To translate our research into impact by delivering applicable insights for the relevant agencies.  Police (improving recording practices, understanding domestic abuse reporting demand characteristics over time for a better allocation of resources), government (temporal/geographical planning of targeted campaigns, intervention programmes), shelters (temporal/geographical allocation of resources), academia (publications)



# Summary

Describe the proposed research in simple terms in a way that could be publicised to a general audience [up to 4000 chars]

description of issue
In the year ending 2018 March, an estimated 2 million adults in England and Wales (7.9% of women and 4.2% of men) have experienced some form of domestic abuse (ONS dom abuse ref). Besides being more likely to experience domestic abuse, compared to men, women are also significantly more likely to endure severe, often lethal violence at home: 41% of femicides, and 0.6% of homicides committed in the year ending 2018 March were domestic abuse-related (ONS homicide ref). The long-lasting effect of domestic abuse are not limited to the direct target of abuse, as it can have severe developmental impacts on children witnessing the abuse. The economic cost of domestic abuse in England and Wales between April, 2016 and March, 2017 was estimated to be \pounds 66 billion (cost ref), taking into account the emotional and physical consequences of the abuse suffered. 

Despite the vast economic cost of domestic abuse, we know relatively little about the risk factors of domestic abuse victimisation in the context of the UK. Previous research has highlighted a number of individual-level characteristics that increase the risk of becoming a victim (being a young woman, pregnancy, financial dependency, recent separation, mental or physical disability). There is some evidence that socioeconomic deprivation is predictive of domestic abuse

Owing to the fact that it occurs in private settings, domestic abuse is a vastly underreported crime: it is estimated that only 17% of victims who experienced any form of domestic abuse between April 2017 and March 2018 reported it to the police (ONS dom abuse ref). 

Our previous investigation of the link between football and domestic abuse had shown that alcohol-related domestic abuse increase by 61% when the England national football team wins.

In this research project, we aim to conduct the first comprehensive investigation of the individual and environmental factors conducive to domestic abuse, and the casual consequences of being a direct or indirect victim of domestic abuse.
