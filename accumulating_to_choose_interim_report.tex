Progress report for ESRC grant ES/N018192/1 ``Accumulating to choose''

Accumulating to choose is an ESRC grant exploring how evidence is accumulated during decision making. It is a collaboration between psychologist and PI Prof. Neil Stewart, and economists Prof. Colin Camerer and Prof. Chris Starmer.  

Named postdoc Dr Tim Mullett began working on the grant on 1 January 2017.Caltech postdoc Devdeepta Bose was hired July 2018, with matched funding from Caltech extending his contract for a second year.  Mullett was hired as an assistant professor in September 2018, but continues to work on the grant. Replacement Dr Charlotte Edmunds joined the project A no-cost extension was granted until 30th June 2020 (in March 2019). Thus the project is now in its third of three funded years.

During the grant over 18 published papers carry the grant number. Core outputs are:
